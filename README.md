### Getting Started

---
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for test and code review purposes. 

### Prerequisites
---
* Node and npm needs to be installed. You would also need an editor like Atom or Visual Studio to view the code
### Installing
---
* To check if Node is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell or a similar command line tool, and type node -v . This should print a version number, so you'll see something like this v0.10.35 . To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal.

* At the prompt:
⋅⋅1. $npm install and once successful run
⋅⋅2. $npm start – you should see the output below:
	Compiled successfully!

	You can now view contacts in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/

* Note:
The selection of shelves retains the state on browser refresh. So on the search page, on a change of state and return to main list page - you would have to refresh the browser to see the updated state
